Assignment 10:
- Distance Vector and Link State Routing Protocols
Question 1) Write a C program to simulate the Distance Vector Routing process for a simple network topology with 4 nodes. The initial topology matrix has been provided below (with "INF" representing no direct link).
   A B C D
A  0 1 4 INF
B  1 0 2 6
C  4 2 0 3
D INF 6 3 0

1. Each node should periodically share its distance vector with its direct neighbors, and update its vector using the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
2. Continue updating each node's table until all distance vectors converge and display the updated routing tables at each step until convergence.
