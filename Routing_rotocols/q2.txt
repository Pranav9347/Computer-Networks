Question 2) Write a C program to simulate Link State Routing in a 4-node network using Dijkstra's algorithm.
The network topology is represented by the following matrix, where each value indicates the link cost between nodes (with "INF" representing no direct link).
   A B C  D
A  0 1 4 INF
B  1 0 2  6
C  4 2 0  3
D INF 6 3 0

1. Display the shortest path and the corresponding path cost from each node to
every other node.
